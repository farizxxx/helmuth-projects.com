<p>Embroidery is more than just a craft, it's a way to spread awareness and hope. That's the idea behind the book Stitching Through Sickness: Embroidery Designs to Spread Awareness and Hope. This book, by Vicki Haninger, contains embroidery designs that are meant to bring light to illnesses and diseases that affect so many people.</p>

<h2>Embroidery as Therapy</h2>

<p>Embroidery has long been considered a therapeutic activity. It can help with stress and anxiety, as well as providing a sense of accomplishment. The designs in Stitching Through Sickness take that therapy to the next level by creating designs that focus on different illnesses.</p>

<h2>Spreading Awareness and Hope</h2>

<p>Embroidery is not only therapeutic for the person doing it, but also serves as a way to spread awareness about different illnesses. For example, the book contains designs for breast cancer awareness, HIV/AIDS awareness, and autism awareness. By stitching these designs and wearing them, people can help start conversations and raise awareness about these important issues.</p>

<h2>Creating a Community</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful things about embroidery is that it can create a sense of community. The designs in Stitching Through Sickness allow people to connect with others who may be going through similar situations. They can also serve as a way to show support for loved ones who are battling illnesses.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Stitching Through Sickness: Embroidery Designs to Spread Awareness and Hope is more than just a book of embroidery designs. It's a way to spread awareness, promote healing, and create a sense of community. By incorporating these designs into our stitching projects, we can help make a difference.</p>
